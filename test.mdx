# My MDX File

This is some *Markdown* content.

Here's a JSX component:

<MyComponent />

You can also write inline JSX expressions like this:

`2 + 2 = {2 + 2}`

And even include code blocks:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, MDX!</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
